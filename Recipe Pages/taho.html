    <h1>Philippines: TAHO (Tah√¥)</h1>
    <h2>recipe by kitchenconfidante.com</h2>
    <h3>Time: 20 minutes</h3>
    <h3>4 servings</h3>
    <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
    <h4><span>16 oz silken tofu <br>1 1/4 cups brown sugar <br>1 cup water <br>1 teaspoon vanilla <br>1 cup tapioca or sago pearls</span></h4>
    <h3>Recipe: </h3>
    <h4><span>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the tapioca pearls according to your package instructions. This can be done in advance; just be sure to store the prepped pearls with some water or a little brown sugar syrup (next step).<br><br>
Combine the brown sugar, water, and vanilla in a small saucepan and place over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, stir to dissolve the sugar, and lower heat to a simmer. Continue simmering for about 2-4 minutes and remove from heat. This syrup, or arnibal, can also be made in advance.<br><br>
Place silken tofu in a parchment lined steamer. Steam for 10-15 minutes, or until heated through. Alternatively, you can microwave the tofu for about 2-5 minutes.<br><br>
To serve, scoop slices of warm silken tofu into a small cup. Top with tapioca or sago pearls. Pour hot brown sugar syrup (arnibal) on top. Serve immediately, while warm.</span><br><br>
